// What it waits for is SIGINT or SIGTERM, whichever comes first, which is the
// shutdown idiom: `co_await when_any(AcceptLoop(), SystemSignalService{}.wait())`.
//
// Like the timer, the wait belongs to the runtime rather than to the handle, so the
// engine is resolved where the wait is queued and a handle owns nothing.
//
// One thing is deliberately *not* done here: constructing a handle does not touch the
// process's signal disposition. Installing the handlers is what the first wait does,
// because a runtime that intercepts SIGINT the moment somebody declares a service
// would be a nasty thing to find in a program that handles its own signals.
