// address it came from, the connecting one without, because that end is the one that
// chose it.

// The connector is taken over rather than pointed at: whoever made the connection
// gives it up here, and the channels are built on it. The service that made it is
// spent, and what is left is one object that owns the connection and can carry bytes
// both ways.
//
// A session cannot be copied or moved -- it owns two channels, and a channel is never
// moved because the multiplexer holds a pointer to it -- so it is handed around as a
// `shared_ptr`, which is what both services answer with. It does not register itself
// with that shared_ptr's control block: whoever holds the pointer is the owner, and
// nothing here needs a way back to itself.
