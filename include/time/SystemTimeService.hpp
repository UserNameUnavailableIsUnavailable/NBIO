// The thread's timer, as a handle: `co_await SystemTimeService{}.sleep(1s)`.
//
// The timer itself belongs to the runtime -- one timerfd per thread, which is what
// makes a sleep cheap and what lets any number of them be in flight at once -- so a
// handle owns nothing and can be made anywhere.
//
// That is also why it resolves the runtime where the wait is queued rather than where
// the handle was made. What a sleep belongs to is the engine driving the coroutine
// that awaits it, so a handle handed to a task running on another thread is still the
// right handle; one that captured a reference in its constructor would be pinned to
// the thread that made it and would outlive nothing. Resolving late also means the
// handle is stateless, so a temporary is as good as a named one -- and the failure
// case is the honest one: a sleep on a thread with no runtime throws where it is
// awaited, naming the thing that is actually missing.
