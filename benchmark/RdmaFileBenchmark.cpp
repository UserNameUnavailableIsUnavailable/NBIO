// The rdma link's throughput, measured the way a user of it would: one chunk per
// message, as many messages in flight as the receiver can take, and a receiver that
// reports what it has taken so the sender stays inside what it has posted.
//
// This is the raw session, with its flow control built here rather than taken from
// RdmaDeliverService -- which is the layer that does the same job for replication,
// and is where that belongs. What is being measured is the session underneath it.
//
// Both ends are in this process, on two engines in two threads -- which is what
// two servers are, one engine each -- because what is being measured is the
// transfer rather than the deployment, and a benchmark whose two halves have to be
// started by hand in two terminals is one nobody runs.
//
// The message size belongs to the resource manager rather than to this program:
// the chunks it registers are what a send is handed and what a receive lands in,
// so the size printed here is the manager's and it moves with the manager when the
// manager's own layout becomes a parameter. There is deliberately no `--chunk`: a
// message larger than a receive chunk is truncated by the device rather than
// refused, so the two sizes have to agree by construction and not by argument.
//
// The flow control is the part that cannot be left out. A receive is a buffer the
// receiver posted, and a message that arrives with none posted is not queued and
// not refused: the sender is told to retry, and a queue pair that runs out of
// retries is torn down with RNR_RETRY_EXC_ERR. A sender gated only by its own send
// completions does not see that coming, because a completion says the message was
// *delivered*, not that the receiver has finished with the buffer it landed in --
// so it will eventually be a whole window ahead of the receiver and break the
// connection. Hence the credits below, and hence the count printed with every run.
