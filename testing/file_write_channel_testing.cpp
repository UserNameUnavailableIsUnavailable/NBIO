// One FileStream is one file descriptor with one write channel, and a channel
// drives one job at a time. Everything that shares a file -- the append-only file
// every client session writes to -- therefore relies on the channel to put the
// writes behind each other rather than let the second one write over the first
// one's job and drop its coroutine.
//
// These tests write from many coroutines at once and read the file back as a
// sequence of whole chunks: nothing may be lost, nothing may be written over, and
// a writer's own chunks have to arrive in the order it wrote them.
