// A buffer is a window over one allocation: bytes go in at the end, come out at
// the front, and what has been read but not consumed is still in there. Growing
// it has to move that window along with the bytes, because a window left where
// it was describes a part of the new allocation the bytes were never copied to.
//
// That is not a corner case for a server: a receive buffer holding the first half
// of a command, or a reply batch that has grown to its first allocation and needs
// more, is exactly a buffer that holds bytes past the front of its storage and
// then grows.
